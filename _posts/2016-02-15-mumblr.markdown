<img src="/images/mumblr.png" class="fit image">Mumblr was my first attempt at a web app; a microblogging site with users, posts and following capabilities. The main feature of Mumblr is a Ruby function that removes every other vowel from a post before its saved to the database. This project was done with Kyle McCloskey and Steven Rayesky.
