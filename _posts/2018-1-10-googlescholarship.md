As of January 10th, I have been selected for the ["Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship"](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google). I am incredibly grateful and excited about this opportunity to enhace my development skills, while learning best practices in a curriculum designed by Google. 

New projects from this course will start appearing in my portfolio over the next couple months, so stay tuned.
